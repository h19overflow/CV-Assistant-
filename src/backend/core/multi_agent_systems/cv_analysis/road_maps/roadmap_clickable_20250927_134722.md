    click S1 "Phase 1: Foundation & Graduation (Now - May 2026): **Objective:** Maximize your remaining time in university to build an outstanding profile that makes you a top-tier candidate upon graduation. **Tangible Actions:** 1.  **Deepen Core Skills:** Advance your Python and SQL skills from intermediate to advanced. Focus on writing efficient, production-quality code. Take advanced courses in algorithms and system design. 2.  **Gain Real-World Experience:** Secure at least one AI/ML-focused internship. Target companies in your desired fields (FinTech, Healthcare, AI/Tech). 3.  **Expand Your Portfolio:** Continue building high-impact projects. Focus on a new area you haven't explored, such as Reinforcement Learning or MLOps automation, to demonstrate breadth. 4.  **Contribute to Open Source:** Find a project on GitHub that aligns with your skills (e.g., libraries like LangChain, Flower, or scikit-learn). Making even small contributions (documentation, bug fixes) is highly valuable. **Skills to Develop:** *   **Technical:** Advanced Python, Advanced SQL, MLOps fundamentals (CI/CD, Docker), Cloud basics (AWS, GCP, or Azure). *   **Soft:** Communication, collaboration, and presenting technical concepts. **Key Milestone:** Graduate with a BSc in Computer Science, 1-2 internships, and a portfolio showcasing 3-5 diverse, high-quality AI/ML projects."
    click S2 "Phase 2: Secure Your First Full-Time Role (Early 2026): **Objective:** Land a role as a Machine Learning Engineer, AI Engineer, or Data Scientist at a company with strong mentorship and growth opportunities. **Tangible Actions:** 1.  **Refine Your Resume:** Tailor your resume for each application, highlighting the projects and skills most relevant to the job description. 2.  **Prepare for Interviews:** Practice LeetCode-style questions (focus on data structures and algorithms), and be prepared to deeply discuss your projects. Study ML system design questions. 3.  **Network:** Attend career fairs, connect with recruiters and engineers on LinkedIn, and leverage your university's alumni network. **Skills to Develop:** *   **Technical:** Interviewing skills (coding, system design), deep understanding of your own projects. *   **Soft:** Professional communication, negotiation. **Key Milestone:** Receive and accept a full-time offer for a relevant entry-level AI/ML position."
    click S3 "Phase 3: Junior/Entry-Level ML Engineer (2026 - 2028): **Objective:** Master the fundamentals of building and deploying production-level ML systems and become a reliable and productive member of the team. **Tangible Actions:** 1.  **Master Production Tools:** Gain expertise in your company's tech stack. Focus on MLOps tools, cloud services, and internal development platforms. 2.  **Learn Software Engineering Best Practices:** Focus on writing clean, tested, and well-documented code. Actively participate in code reviews (both giving and receiving feedback). 3.  **Take Ownership:** Start by owning smaller features or bug fixes. Gradually take on responsibility for a complete component of an ML system. 4.  **Find a Mentor:** Identify a senior engineer on your team or in the company to guide your technical and career growth. **Skills to Develop:** *   **Technical:** Cloud Platforms (AWS SageMaker, Google AI Platform, or Azure ML), Containerization (Docker, Kubernetes), CI/CD for ML, monitoring and logging. *   **Soft:** Teamwork, receiving feedback, time management. **Key Milestone:** Independently own and successfully deploy a machine learning model or a significant feature into production."
    click S4 "Phase 4: Mid-Level ML Engineer (2028 - 2031): **Objective:** Evolve from executing tasks to designing systems and leading projects. Begin to specialize and increase your influence. **Tangible Actions:** 1.  **Lead a Project:** Take the lead on a small-to-medium-sized project, from initial design and requirements gathering to final deployment and maintenance. 2.  **Mentor Others:** Begin mentoring interns or new junior engineers. This will solidify your own knowledge and develop leadership skills. 3.  **Develop a Specialization:** Based on your interests and company needs, deepen your expertise in a specific area like LLMs/GenAI, MLOps, or Computer Vision. Your project background gives you a great starting point in these areas. 4.  **Improve System Design:** Move beyond model-building and focus on the entire system architecture. Learn to design scalable, reliable, and cost-effective ML systems. **Skills to Develop:** *   **Technical:** ML System Design, advanced MLOps, and deep expertise in a chosen specialization. *   **Soft:** Project management, technical leadership, mentoring, cross-functional communication. **Key Milestone:** Be promoted to Mid-Level Engineer. Successfully lead a project from conception to launch that delivers measurable business value."
    click S5 "Phase 5: Senior AI/ML Engineer (2031+): **Objective:** Achieve your goal of becoming a Senior AI/ML Engineer, where you are responsible for technical strategy, architecting complex systems, and elevating the entire team. **Tangible Actions:** 1.  **Architect Major Systems:** Design and own the architecture for large-scale, critical AI/ML systems. 2.  **Drive Technical Strategy:** Influence your team's roadmap. Identify and advocate for new technologies, tools, and best practices that can improve efficiency and results. 3.  **Amplify Your Impact:** Act as a force multiplier by mentoring multiple engineers, setting technical standards, and creating resources (e.g., documentation, tutorials, internal libraries) for the team. 4.  **Engage with the Community:** Consider sharing your expertise outside the company through tech blogs, conference talks, or open-source contributions. **Skills to Develop:** *   **Technical:** Advanced System Architecture, technical strategy, ability to evaluate and integrate new technologies. *   **Soft:** Technical mentorship at scale, influencing without authority, strategic thinking, stakeholder management. **Key Milestone:** Promotion to Senior AI/ML Engineer, recognized as a go-to expert for a critical domain within your organization."
